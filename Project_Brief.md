Suggested user: Casual Gamer

You have been tasked to create a miniature arcade for a microtransaction based entertainment firm. The company needs a way to keep a record of players and their scores and progress. This system is for clients to use.


## <ins>MVP:</ins>

The system must:

1)	Allow a selected player to play a game.


2)  Users score at the end of the game to be logged to a scoreboard.


3)	Allow the viewing of scoreboards for individual games.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Scoreboards should detail:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Username

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Score

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Date (and) time of score.


4)	Allow the viewing of users scores for the available games.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * If the user has not played a game, the score should be zero.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * This means creating a score entry for a username when the name is first used which is them updated.


5)	The minimum game selection will comprise:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Snake

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Breakout

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Runner

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Paper, Rock, Scissors

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * (Any additional game must have a score attribute which can be logged to the database.)


## <ins>Project Extensions:</ins>


1) Games should be unlockable, with the player required to achieve a minimum score in the previous game.


2) Calculate how much time a player has spent playing any game and their total arcade play time.


3) Unlocking content based on play time as well as / instead of score.
